                <p class='bio'>
                    Jessica is an amateur photographer from Calgary who specializes in wildlife and theme park photography. This year she graduates from UBCO with her BSc in Zoology.</p>
                <p class='bio'>
                    She is completely self-taught and is always excited about learning new tips and tricks and trying out new styles.  When she's not photographing animals, she can be found listening to Taylor Swift's music, attempting to write novels, and playing soccer. </p>

                    <p class='photobio'><b>Caption: </b>My friend had me out to her place over the Thanksgiving weekend and naturally, I had to take photos of her dogs. He had seen something fly by overhead while standing right in front of me.</p>

                    <p class='photobio'><b>Caption: </b>This photo was taken at RZSS Edinburgh Zoo in the Fall of 2019. I had stopped by the koala enclosure just as the keeper's had woken them up for their weekly weigh checks. Afterwards, they were active for about an hour. As koala's sleep for 18-22hrs a day, I consider this a bit of a lucky shot.</p>

                    <p class='photobio'><b>Caption: </b>Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland has some of the prettiest sunsets I've ever seen. This photo was shot from Calton Hill looking out towards Prince's Street. It was taken in the Fall of 2019 while I was on exchange at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
