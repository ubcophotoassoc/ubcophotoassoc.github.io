                    <p class='photobio'><b>Caption: </b>Little Squirrel. I saw this squirrel munching on peanuts that someone left in Stanley Park. It was so caught up in eating I was able to get close for a photo.</p>

                    <p class='photobio'><b>Caption: </b>Mule Deer. This photograph was taken of a juvenile mule deer at Knox Mountain Park. It was a cloudy day causing a darker/moodier scene. Of course the deer saw me and was curious of my presence, explaining the intense gaze into the camera.</p>
